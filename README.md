## 🏢 Mainder — Founding Engineer (Core Full-Stack)

I’m a founding engineer at Mainder (HRTech / Recruiting SaaS). We built the product from the start and we’ve owned critical systems across core backend, automation, and frontend:

### Multiposting system 
- We designed and implemented the multiposting system as a Ruby on Rails microservice
- We built execution + orchestration around Redis + Sidekiq (scheduled/background workloads)
- We worked on database workflows, reliability patterns, and operational robustness

### Core backend 
- We built and maintained backend workflows connecting product features, integrations, and data integrity
- We implemented production-grade worker flows and third-party API integrations

### Frontend 
- I’m currently focused on the frontend with Next.js + TypeScript
- I’m reworking product flows with a modular, maintainable architecture

### InfoJobs Worker 
- I rebuilt the InfoJobs Worker: an autonomous worker that scrapes InfoJobs and performs actions inside the portal
- Implemented in Python + Playwright, designed to run end-to-end without manual intervention
- Built to handle layout changes, dynamic UI behavior, and real-world variance
